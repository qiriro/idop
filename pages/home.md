Although the recent COVID-19 pandemic is arguably the most disastrous pandemic of the 21st
century, disease outbreaks regularly occur, albeit on a geographically limited scope. For
example, in the past decade alone, previously unknown diseases such as the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus (MERS), and the Influenza A virus subtype H7N9 inflicted havoc upon the
communities and regions where they emerged. Likewise, humanity is not safe with known
communicable diseases such as Ebola, Zika virus, cholera, tuberculosis, and measles.
For the least developed countries, outbreaks of communicable diseases poses particular
challenges. Indeed, low-income countries lack adequate sanitation and hygiene infrastructure
and have limited financial resources to trace, identify, test, and quarantine suspect cases.
Additionally, unexpected disease outbreaks put pressure on the already overburdened and
underfunded healthcare.

While the World Health Organization (WHO) advocates for methods to rapidly pinpoint
and isolate infected people before there is a major outbreak, there exist no pragmatic methods
to detect and prevent infectious diseases before they spread. The few promising solutions
expect the availability of high-level infrastructure, require advanced know-how, and
necessitate significant financial resources; thus, are not practical in the context of developing
countries. When everyone needs better information, including epidemic disease researchers,
government authorities, and international organizations, digital information, and surveillance
technologies are relevant tools to collect data and reliable evidence to support public health
decision-making.

This project proposes to leverage the ubiquitous mobile payment systems in order to collect
location data to be used to detect infectious diseases in their early stage and to help decisionmakers take adequate countermeasures to prevent their spread. The proposed approach hinges on the possibility of estimating the geographic location of each mobile payment transaction and the identification of the customer/user. Such data, together with live data of infection test results, allows the development of models that enable the detection of infectious diseases before they spread widely and can be used to identify clusters of infected people and estimate the diseaseâ€™s super-spreading potential. The proposed approach is low-cost, pragmatic, and is applicable to the context of developing countries. The present project involves the collaboration between the University of Rwanda, Universite Gaston Berger (Senegal), and LocationMind Inc (Japan).
